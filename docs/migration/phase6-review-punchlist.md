# Phase 6 — page review punch-list

Living punch-list from the page-by-page review of the assembled Phase 6 pages
(epic [#66]). Captured during a guided preview walkthrough; updated per page.

**Status:** `[ ]` open · `[x]` done · `[~]` in progress
**Type:** AFK (mechanical) · HITL (needs a decision)

### Progress log (AFK batch — done)

Committed on `feat/phase6` (not pushed):

- **`6b3b618`** — render fixes: **PR1** Card 1:1 image · **PR2** Card no description · **NY1** FeatureSplit 16:9 · **AV1** Academy YouTube thumbnails · **AV2** strip category prefix · **CS4** hide legacy-id testimonial authors (render guard) · **C1** shared autoplay Carousel + MediaGallery autoplay.
- **`fad2812`** — **C4** CardGrid full-bleed linked image cards (render-only; existing `enableCardLink`/`cardLink`, no schema change).
- **`8654270`** — seed wave: **C8** accordions collapsed · **B1** State Committee Presidents group · **B2/AC2/SC1** recovered About-Us intro copy · **CS3** career headline · **LA2** short CTA · **H1** Latest Updates 12 · **H2** program cards full-bleed linked images · **H3** membership cards link to /join · **H5** community slider to bottom · **MCB1/MCB2** Signal cards clickable / state cards keep buttons · **EV1** new /latest-updates page.
- **`8e13fc9`** — **C2** Testimonials slider variant · **C3** ArchiveBlock slider · **NY2** NY gallery slider · home Latest Updates + both testimonials now sliders (**H4**) · **CS2** career testimonials slider. Regenerated payload-types.
- **`ac67d33`** — Outseta: single-script SDK init fix; members gate restored (server-side). TEMP review bypasses removed.
- **`1f415e9`** — **P1** backfill ~28 partner logos from the live CDN → LogoStrip now shows 31 · **DN1** PayPal/Zelle logos (PayPal rasterized from SVG) + per-method QR codes wired into the donate comparison table. `rehost-images` gained remote-CDN support + dedupes by the stored `.webp` name.

Also **CS1/LA1** (program support-card full-bleed) are satisfied by the C4 render change. **D1** resolved (site-wide).

### Decided (walkthrough 2) — DONE

Built + preview-verified, committed on `feat/phase6` (not pushed):

- **`00265f0`** — **M1** MediaGallery `density: compact` (four-up square photo wall, tight gaps) · **JU1** MapLocationCards now a client Maps-JS-API map with one marker per geocoded location + an InfoWindow showing that location's card on click (lat/lng fields added; degrades to cards-only with no key). Regenerated payload-types.
- **`3bb29fe`** — seed data: **M1** mission gallery set to compact · **JU1** coordinates for all 9 Jumuah locations · **JU2** slug → `/resources/jumuah-services` + redirect + stale old-slug page removed on reseed · **C6** exact per-group team order from the live site · **C7** removed the generic testimonials block from community-building / legal-advocacy / policy-initiatives / public-sector-engagement · `revalidateRedirects` honors `disableRevalidate`.
- **`b671cf1`** — **C5** sticky scroll-spy TOC (`PageTOC`) for long content pages: self-gates at 3+ section headings, reserves a left rail at xl+, hidden below xl.
- **`690cc26`** — **G1/D2** header hamburger overlay at all breakpoints with the full IA + Donate/Join CTAs + Outseta login/logout ([#115]); header no longer reads the CMS nav global.
- **C6/b** — Team `inactive` flag (sidebar toggle) + null-safe block query; **Hasan Shanawani** hidden so the board matches the source (12 / 3 at-large). Reversible, no delete.

**Notes / deviations to confirm:**

- **C7 changed approach (live data contradicted the plan).** Gather found **none** of the 5 live program pages show testimonials — so a `program` tag field would tag nothing. Faithful port = remove the generic block from the 4 non-career program pages (matches your original "remove" instinct); career-support keeps its `career` set per your instruction. No tag field added. _Revert any block to restore it if you'd rather curate per-program._
- **C6 resolved (walkthrough 3):** (a) the Presidents-tab float (**Fatima Abdelsalam** + **Hon. Samia Naseem** above Basem Hassan — a single `order` field can't hold two independent ranks) is **accepted as-is**: cosmetic, exact everywhere else. (b) **Hasan Shanawani** (in the import's board, not on the live board) is **hidden via a new `inactive` flag** on Team — board now matches the source (12 / 3 at-large). The flag is a reversible per-member sidebar toggle (record preserved, not deleted); the block query is null-safe so existing members are unaffected. Seed sets it via `TEAM_INACTIVE`.
- **M1 done** — the 2 supplied community photos (Georgetown Law panel + MAPS at the U.S. DOJ) are in the grid (now 9). Converted to optimized webp (the DOJ one from HEIC via a transient decoder), committed under `public/import/prose/`. `seed-pages` `mediaId` is now self-healing — it creates a Media doc from the tracked source if absent, so a fresh DB reproduces the gallery without `import:prose`. Layout refined: compact density now honors the `columns` field (mission set to `3` → clean 3×3) and tiles are **4:3** (was square) so the landscape group photos aren't center-cropped/zoomed.
- **JU1 / JU2 dev caveat:** map markers + InfoWindows verified live; the old-slug redirect needs a fresh `getCachedRedirects` (a `next build` or a `.next` clear) — production builds regenerate it automatically.
- **Punch-list reconciled (walkthrough 4):** every item is now `[x]`. The two items previously deferred to standalone issues are built — **CO1** (contact form, #98) and **JN1** (`/join` Outseta plan modal). Checkboxes lower in this doc were flipped to match the committed reality recorded in the progress log above.

### Closed

- **CS4** — keep imported testimonials as quote-only (source has no names). Render guard already in place. **Done.**

### Still HITL / not yet decided

- (none — all walked through)

When the walkthrough finishes, the feature-level clusters here get converted to
proper issues (header nav, carousel primitive, card pattern); the small tweaks
are applied in a batch against the seed/blocks.

---

## Open decisions

- [x] **D1 — Card pattern scope. RESOLVED → site-wide.** Full-bleed image cards are the **default for all comparable CardGrids** (programs/members/resources). Confirmed on PSE. See [C4].
- [x] **D2 — Header menu treatment.** → hamburger overlay at all breakpoints (done, `690cc26`). Hamburger overlay at **all** breakpoints, or desktop nav bar + hamburger on mobile only? _(user leans hamburger)_

## Cross-cutting / component work (emerges from items below)

- [x] **C1 — Autoplay carousel primitive.** One shared auto-playing carousel reused by the Testimonials slider (H4) and the Latest Updates slider (H1). Build once.
- [x] **C2 — Testimonials block: add `slider` variant + autoplay** (today only `grid` / `single`).
- [x] **C3 — ArchiveBlock: slider treatment** for the Latest Updates feed on home (H1).
- [x] **C4 — CardGrid: "linked image card" pattern** — full-bleed image, whole card clickable (`enableCardLink` + `cardLink`), no button, keep border. **Scope: site-wide** (D1 resolved) — apply to every comparable CardGrid (home H2/H3, all program support-area grids [CS1]/[LA1], members, resources). The **clickable-surface + no-button** behavior can also apply to **imageless** cards where called out (e.g. [MCB1]) — but it's **opt-in per section**, not automatic (some imageless cards keep their buttons, see [MCB2]).
- [x] **C8 — Accordions collapsed by default** _(global)_. Every accordion/FAQ block site-wide starts collapsed, not expanded. Generalizes [CB2]. _(AFK — accordion `defaultOpen` off everywhere)_
- [x] **C7 — Targeted testimonials per page** _(done, `3bb29fe` — live shows none, so removed from the 4 non-career program pages)_ _(HITL: the per-page mapping)_. Instead of removing the Testimonials block from program pages (supersedes [CB1]/[LA3]), each program page should show testimonials **relevant to that program**. The Programs testimonials CSV is a flat 13-item bucket with **no program field**, so targeting can't be auto-derived. Need a curation mechanism — a `program`/tag field on Testimonials (or a relationship pick on the block) — and the per-page selection sourced from what each **live** program page displays. Career-support keeps its `career` set. _(mechanism AFK; the mapping is HITL — read from live site)_
- [x] **C6 — Team member ordering must follow source role hierarchy** _(done, `3bb29fe`)_ _(all team pages)_. Members are currently in import/CSV order, not the source's deliberate ordering (President → Vice President → … then the rest). Order is **not alphabetical** — it's role-rank. Need an explicit per-member order field (or a role-rank sort) so each Team block renders in the source's order. Generalizes [AC1]. _(AFK — add order field to Team + set from source order)_
- [x] **C5 — Sticky left TOC for content pages** _(done, `b671cf1`)_ _(HITL: scope + which pages)_. Sticky, left-rail table of contents that scroll-spies the page's section headings (mission, faq, and other long prose/Content pages). _Note: the Team page does **not** currently have a TOC (it has a filter/tab bar) — this is net-new, no existing component to reuse._ Needs: anchor IDs auto-derived from headings (Content/prose blocks), a sticky `aside` + scroll-spy highlight, collapses/hides on mobile. Decide which page set gets it.

---

## Global (header / footer / site-wide)

- [x] **G1 — Header nav menu** _(done, `690cc26`)_ _(HITL: D2 + IA)_. Today the header is just logo + "Home" + "Search". Build a real menu (hamburger overlay per D2), keeping the current hero design. Folds in the login/logout control ([#115]). Proposed IA:
  - About Us → Mission · FAQ · Partners · Board & Leadership · Advisory Council · State Committees
  - Programs → Career Support · Community Building · Legal Advocacy · Policy Initiatives · Public Sector Engagement
  - Resources → Federal Employment · Jumuah Services · Fellowships (Young) · Fellowships (Mid-Career→Senior)
  - Members → Portal + member pages (gated → login)
  - Press · Events · Contact · Donate / Join (buttons)

- [x] **G2 — Header icons (and logo) invisible over the dark hero in light mode** _(done, uncommitted)_ → the search + hamburger controls used the dead `text-content` token (no `--color-content` defined), so they inherited the **site** `--foreground` and ignored the header's per-page `data-theme` — on the HighImpact hero in light mode that's dark-on-dark. Also `PageClient` force-set the header theme to `light`, fighting `HighImpactHero`'s `dark`. Fix: icons use `text-foreground` (follows the header `data-theme`), and `PageClient` removed so heros drive the header theme as designed (also fixes the logo variant on the hero). _(AFK)_

- [x] **G3 — Consistent breadcrumbs on all interior pages, with verified links** _(done, uncommitted)_ → breadcrumbs are now **derived render-side** in `[...slug]/page.tsx` from the page's slug + title (Home → section as plain text → current page), overriding the drifted per-page seed data. This eliminates the **4 broken** section-index links (`/members`, `/programs`, `/resources` have no landing page → section crumb is now plain text), fills the **5 missing** pages (about-us trio, donate, join), normalizes the Home-rooted style across all pages, and fixes content bugs surfaced in the audit (final crumb said "Private Sector Engagement" → now "Public…"; em-dash labels → commas). No reseed — derives from DB title/slug. _Follow-up: the now-dead `hero.breadcrumbs` seed arrays + em-dash page **titles** can be cleaned in a reseed (separate)._ _(AFK)_

- [x] **G4 — Surface a prominent Login/Logout control in the header top bar** _(done, uncommitted)_ → moved the single Outseta `o-login-link` / `o-logout-link` pair out of the overlay menu into the always-visible header top bar, immediately **before** the search icon (ids kept unique so the no-code binder still wires the click; `data-o-anonymous` / `data-o-authenticated` show exactly one by auth state). Styled `text-foreground uppercase tracking-wide` to track the per-page header theme. _(AFK — NavMenu)_

- [x] **G5 — Footer does not match the live site** _(done, uncommitted)_ → rebuilt `src/Footer/Component.tsx` to mirror the live footer: brand logo + intro copy, **3 columns** (Programs & Services / About / Follow us), **5 social** links (new tab), and copyright. Structure is **hardcoded** (footer no longer reads the `footer` CMS global — matches the header-nav precedent), brand tokens only. Newsletter is an **inert placeholder** (input + Subscribe), not wired to any provider per request (Mailchimp dropped). Theme selector kept, tucked into the bottom credit row. _(port)_

- [x] **G6 — Home "Latest Updates" slider has no "View all updates" CTA** _(done, uncommitted)_ → added a `cta` block directly after the home Latest Updates slider with a "View all updates" → `/latest-updates` outline button (reused the existing CallToAction block, seed-only — no schema change, avoids cross-branch drift). Reseeded. _(AFK — seed)_

- [x] **G7 — Add a "Latest Updates" link to the header nav + footer** _(done, uncommitted)_ → added "Latest Updates" → `/latest-updates` to the header overlay flat row (`Press · Events · Latest Updates · Contact`, `src/Header/NavMenu.tsx`) and to the footer's "Programs & Services" column (`src/Footer/Component.tsx`, after Events). _(AFK)_

- [x] **G8 — Events not a primary header-nav item** → **Done.** Promoted Events to its own primary nav column with sub-items: Upcoming Events (`/events/upcoming`), MAPS Events (`/events/maps`), Partner Events (`/events/partner`), All Events (`/events`). The three child pages are seeded (`eventsSlice`) as Archive blocks each filtered to one EVENT-type Post category; LowImpact headers give clean `Home / Events / <title>` breadcrumbs (added `events` to `SECTION_LABELS`). Removed Events from the flat row; nav grid bumped to `xl:grid-cols-5` so all five groups sit on one row.

- [x] **G9 — Members nav column renders empty for logged-out visitors** → **Done (show links to all).** Root cause: Outseta's nocode module injects `<style id="o-hide-content-groups">a[href^="/members" i]{display:none!important}`, hiding every member nav link from anonymous users and leaving an empty "Members" heading. But the `/members/*` routes are already gated server-side ([src/middleware.ts](../../src/middleware.ts) verifies the Outseta JWT and redirects unauthenticated requests to login), so the client-side hiding is redundant and only breaks the menu. Fix: a nav-scoped override in `globals.css` (`#primary-menu a[href^='/members' i]{display:revert!important}`) whose `1,1,1` specificity outweighs Outseta's `0,1,1`, so all 7 links show to everyone; a logged-out click just hits the gate and redirects to login (no content leaks). Verified: Outseta's hide style is present yet the 7 links compute `display:inline`.

## Home (`/`)

- [x] **H1 — Latest Updates** → slider/carousel showing **12 items** (currently a static 3-card grid). _(AFK seed + C3)_
- [x] **H2 — MAPS Programs cards** → full-bleed image per card, **whole card clickable** → program page, **remove "Learn More" buttons**, keep border. Source images: `4_1.webp` (Career Support), `5_1.webp` (Community Building), `policy.webp` (Policy & Advocacy). _(AFK seed + C4; needs image re-host)_
- [x] **H3 — MAPS Membership cards** → same treatment as H2; cards link → `/join`. Membership card images TBD from source home. _(AFK seed + C4)_
- [x] **H4 — Both Testimonials blocks** (Programs + Membership) → **slider with autoplay** (currently static grids). _(C1 + C2)_
- [x] **H5 — "MAPS National in the community" slider** → move to the **bottom** of the page, right before the footer (currently directly under the hero). _(AFK seed reorder)_
- [x] **Outseta `[domain]` init error** — fixed: single script sets `window.o_options` then injects the SDK (was a `beforeInteractive` race in the route-group layout). _(done, uncommitted in working tree)_
- [x] **H6 — Small gap above the hero background image** → **permanently fixed.** A thin strip of page background showed above the HighImpact hero. Root cause confirmed: the hero's pull-up was a hand-tuned `-mt-[10.4rem]` that had to equal header height (6.5rem) + the article's `pt-16` (4rem) = 10.5rem; the 10.4 left a ~1.6px gap, and the value silently drifted whenever the header or padding changed (recurred twice). Fix: header height and article top-pad are now single-source-of-truth vars in `globals.css` `:root` — `--header-height` (header pinned via `h-[var(--header-height)]`) and `--page-top-pad` (article `pt`); the hero offset is `-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+var(--page-top-pad))]`. Verified flush at `top:0` on home + post. See CLAUDE.md → Theming (header/hero overlay geometry). _(done, uncommitted)_

- [x] **H7 — Member login loops back to home on localhost** → reported: signing in just bounces between login and home. Root cause: [src/middleware.ts](../../src/middleware.ts) redirected anonymous `/members/*` to Outseta's **hosted** login, whose post-login redirect is the **prod** domain — on localhost the token cookie lands on the wrong origin and never returns, so the gate loops (and localhost can't be whitelisted as an Outseta callback). Fix: middleware now bounces anonymous `/members/*` to `/` on `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` instead of the hosted page; devs log in via the **embedded** top-bar Login widget, which writes the cookie same-origin. Prod keeps the hosted gate unchanged. Verified: anon `/members/community-building` → `localhost:3000/` (200), `/members/portal` stays public. _(dev-only)_

- [x] **H8 — Header "Login" did nothing (no modal)** → clicking Login in the top bar had no effect. Root cause: the port gave the anchors element `id="o-login-link"`/`"o-logout-link"` expecting Outseta's nocode module to bind them, but Outseta binds **href fragments** (the source used `href=".../auth?widgetMode=login#o-anonymous"`), not element ids — so the `onClick` only `preventDefault`'d. Fix ([src/Header/NavMenu.tsx](../../src/Header/NavMenu.tsx)): wire the clicks to the SDK — `window.Outseta.auth.open({ widgetMode: 'login' })` opens the login **modal in-page** (no hosted redirect → cookie written same-origin, works on localhost), `window.Outseta.logout()` clears the session. Visibility still handled by `data-o-anonymous`/`data-o-authenticated` (verified: shows exactly one by auth state); dropped the dead ids. Verified: clicking Login renders the `o--Widget--popupBg` modal.

- [ ] **H9 — Verify "Sign in with Google" SSO on prod (external config, not code)** → on localhost the Google social login in the Outseta modal fails with `Error 400: origin_mismatch` because the in-page origin `http://localhost:3000` isn't an authorized JavaScript origin on the Google OAuth client Outseta uses. Not an app bug (`OutsetaScript` doesn't configure Google; it's all Outseta-dashboard/Google-Cloud-side). **Local workaround:** test with email/password login. **To resolve:** if MAPS uses a **custom** Google OAuth client (Outseta → Settings → Login → Google shows a Client ID), add `http://localhost:3000` to its Authorized JavaScript origins in Google Cloud Console for local testing; otherwise (Outseta-managed client) just **verify Google SSO end-to-end on the prod/staging domain**, where the origin is already registered. _(HITL — verify on prod; possible Google Cloud Console origin add)_

## About Us

### `/about-us/mission`

- [x] **M1 — "MAPS in the community" gallery** _(done, `00265f0`/`3bb29fe`; +2 photos still held)_ → add **2 more photos** (7 → 9, fills the 3-col grid evenly) and render the tiles **smaller** (tighter cell size — more columns or smaller aspect). _(AFK seed + MediaGallery)_

### `/about-us/board-leadership`

- [x] **B1 — Missing "State Committee Presidents" group** → the page doesn't show this team group (the 4th group whose category routing was unresolved at assembly). Surface it as its own grouped section on the page. _(AFK seed — map the team category onto this page's Team block)_
- [x] **B2 — Full body copy missing** → only the one-line hero intro is present; the page's full descriptive/section copy from the source was not ported. Pull the complete copy from the source. **Likely systemic** — audit the other About-Us / interior pages for the same thinned-out copy. _(AFK — re-extract from source HTML / live site)_

### `/about-us/advisory-council`

- [x] **AC1 — Member order** → reorder the advisory council members to match the live site's order. _(AFK — read order from live page; set Team category/member ordering)_
- [x] **AC2 — Missing text** → only the one-line hero intro; full page copy missing (same as [B2]). _(AFK — re-extract from source)_

### `/about-us/state-committees`

- [x] **SC1 — Missing text** → only the one-line hero intro; full page copy (committee list + descriptions) missing (same as [B2]). _(AFK — re-extract from source)_

### `/about-us/partners`

- [x] **P1 — Backfill the missing partner logos** → only 3 of ~32 are live (export had only aafen/minaret/uscmo). **Pull the rest from the live site's partners page** — scrape the logo `<img>` CDN URLs off `mapsnational.webflow.io`, download → re-host as Media (extend `rehost:images`). _(AFK — was HITL; live site is the source)_

## Donate / Join / Contact

### `/donate`

- [x] **DN1 — Missing payment logos + QR codes** → the donation methods table is missing the **Zelle** and **PayPal** logos and the **per-method QR codes**. **Assets are on the live site: https://mapsnational.webflow.io/donate** — scrape the logo + QR image URLs, download → re-host as Media, bind into the table. (Confirm SVG handling if any are SVG; QRs are likely PNG.) _(AFK — live site is the source)_

### `/contact-us`

- [x] **CO1 — Add a contact form** _(done — Payload form-builder; #98)_ → `/contact-us` now renders a `formBlock` (Full name · Email · Subject · Message → "Send message") above the contact details. The form is **owned + upserted by `seed-pages`** (by title), so a reseed keeps it and a fresh DB recreates it; notifies `info@mapsnational.org`. **Email delivery:** Webflow's baked-in form email is replaced by a Payload email adapter — `@payloadcms/email-resend`, **env-gated** in `payload.config.ts` like the S3 adapter. Submissions always persist to the `form-submissions` collection (admin); when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set (+ sending domain verified in Resend) the notification emails actually send. Sender driven by `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`/`EMAIL_FROM_NAME` (verify a subdomain e.g. `send.mapsnational.org` so the root Workspace MX/SPF is untouched). Without the key, Payload's console fallback logs the attempt (dev default).

### `/join`

- [x] **JN1 — "Apply" CTAs must open the Outseta plan modal** _(done)_ → the tier "Apply" links dropped `newTab`, so the `…/auth?widgetMode=register&planUid=…#o-anonymous` anchors are no longer `target="_blank"`. The loaded nocode module (`monitorDom`) now intercepts the click and opens the **plan-signup modal in place** (verified: click stays on `/join`, Outseta modal renders) — matching the source.

## Press / Events

### `/press`

- [x] **PR1 — ArchiveBlock card images → consistent 1:1, clip** → cards show images at native ratios (3:2, etc.), so heights vary. Enforce a **consistent** card image aspect (target **1:1**) and `object-cover`-clip any non-square source to fit. Applies to **all ArchiveBlock card images** — confirmed on `/press` **and `/events`**; also home Latest Updates. _(AFK — Card image aspect)_
- [x] **PR2 — Remove card subtitle/description text** → the Card renders a description paragraph (post summary) that makes cards too tall. Drop the description from the Card (keep title + category + image). Applies to **all ArchiveBlock cards**. _(AFK — Card component)_

### `/events`

- [x] **EV1 — "View all updates" → 404** → the button links to `/latest-updates`, which has no seeded page (only this link references that slug). Either **create** a Latest Updates archive page at `/latest-updates` (ArchiveBlock of all Posts) or **repoint** the button to an existing listing. Audit other "View all" CTAs for the same dead slug. _(AFK seed)_

## Members

### `/members/portal`

- [x] **MP1 — Portal landing rebuilt as a full member home** → the post-login landing was a "Coming soon" stub (live portal content was behind Outseta auth, not in the static export). Fetched the real authed live portal (member token) as the reference and rebuilt the page to match, with an improved, gap-free hero (a "Welcome Card + dashboard tiles" hybrid chosen via a judged design pass, replacing the live hero's empty-gap two-column layout). Sections: (1) a custom **MemberPortalHero** block — personalized "Welcome, {FirstName}!" from `Outseta.getUser()` (falls back to "Welcome!"), four action tiles (Sign Up for Events → events section, Update Profile → `Outseta.profile.open()` modal, Member-Only Resources / State Committee Pages → in-page jumps), and an optional faded photo-collage background (`public/portal/member-collage.webp`); (2) **Upcoming Member-Only Events** — Archive filtered to the Upcoming Events category; (3) **MAPS Programs & Services** — 2×2 cards linking to the four member areas; (4) **Get Involved with MAPS** — 8-tile action grid; (5) **MAPS State Committee Pages** — band with the MAPS New York card. Page hero set to `type: none`; jumps use new `anchorId` on Archive + existing CardGrid `anchorId`, with `scroll-mt` + smooth-scroll (reduced-motion aware). Verified end-to-end (personalized greeting + faded collage + tiles + all sections; no console errors). _(AFK seed + block)_
  - **Get Involved buttons → `/contact-us` placeholder.** The live site's Get Involved buttons had no destinations; ours route to Contact until real per-action targets exist. _(follow-up: real links)_
  - **"Experts & Points of Contact"** links to our existing `/members/resources-points-of-contact` page (live had it as "Coming Soon"; we have the page).

### `/members/community-building`

- [x] **MCB1 — Make the Signal-chat cards fully clickable, remove buttons** → the **"Join Signal Chat Groups"** cards (MAPS Member & Associate Chat, MAPS Social Chat, MAPS Affiliate Chat) have a "Join" button — make the **whole card** the clickable surface (target = the button's href) and **remove the button**. Same whole-card-clickable + no-button intent as [C4], but these are **imageless** text cards. **Scope: only this Signal-chat section.** _(AFK — CardGrid `enableCardLink` for imageless cards)_
- [x] **MCB2 — State cards keep their buttons** → the **"Connect in your state"** cards (Massachusetts, California, …) **keep** their "Join on Signal" buttons; do **not** make them whole-card links. _(explicit: no change)_

### `/members/new-york-state`

- [x] **NY1 — FeatureSplit images → 16:9, clipped** → images render at their native (square/tall) ratio, dwarfing the opposite text column. Constrain each to a **wide 16:9** aspect and `object-cover` clip so the image height balances the adjacent copy. Apply to **all** FeatureSplit rows on this page. _(AFK — FeatureSplit image aspect/`object-cover`)_
- [x] **NY2 — "MAPS New York in the community" gallery → slider** → convert the photo grid to a slider, same treatment as the home community slider ([H5]). Uses the shared carousel primitive ([C1]). _(AFK seed — MediaGallery slider mode)_

### `/members/maps-academy-vids`

- [x] **AV1 — Video tiles missing thumbnails** _(all AcademyVideos blocks site-wide — also on `/members/policy-legal-advocacy`)_ → tiles show only a play button on a tinted placeholder, no poster image. Add thumbnails — auto-derive from the video ID where possible (YouTube `img.youtube.com/vi/{id}/hqdefault.jpg`; Vimeo via oEmbed) or a `thumbnail` Media field on the collection. _(needs block/import work)_
- [x] **AV2 — Strip "MAPS Academy" prefix from filter tabs** → category filter labels read "MAPS Academy: Public Service Executive & Senior Official Pathways" etc. Drop the redundant "MAPS Academy" prefix from the VideoCategory labels. _(AFK — fix category titles in import/seed)_

## Resources

### `/resources/jumuah-prayer-services-washington-dc`

- [x] **JU1 — Drop a pin per location on the map** _(done, `00265f0`/`3bb29fe`)_ → the MapLocationCards map should show each Jumuah location as a **map pin/marker**, not a single generic embed. _Note: the current block uses the Google Maps **Embed API** (one place per iframe) — multi-marker needs the Maps **JavaScript API** (markers from the `locations` array) or a custom-map embed; meaningful change to the block._ _(needs block work)_
- [x] **JU2 — Shorten slug** _(done, `3bb29fe` — `/resources/jumuah-services` + redirect)_ → `jumuah-prayer-services-washington-dc` is long; consider `jumuah-services`. _(AFK — but breaks any existing inbound links/redirects)_

## Programs

### `/programs/career-support`

- [x] **CS1 — Full-bleed card images** → the three support-area cards have padded, inset images (`p-6` + `aspect-video` inside the border). Make the image **full-bleed** to the card edges (image flush to top/sides, copy padded below). Same full-bleed treatment as [C4]/[H2]. _(AFK — CardGrid full-bleed image variant)_
- [x] **CS2 — Testimonials → slider** → the career testimonials render as a static grid; make them an autoplay slider ([C1]+[C2]).
- [x] **CS3 — Section headline specific to the program** → "What our community says" is generic. Make the testimonials headline (and eyebrow) specific to **training / career support**. _(AFK — per-block heading field)_
- [x] **CS4 — Author names show numeric IDs** → testimonial authors render as `10` / `11` (the legacy numeric slug/ID), not real names. The author name/title field didn't import. **Likely systemic across all Testimonials.** _(AFK — fix testimonials import mapping / backfill author)_

### `/programs/community-building`

- [x] **CB1 — ~~Remove testimonials section~~ → superseded by [C7]** (use targeted testimonials, don't remove). _(AFK seed)_
- [x] **CB2 — ~~Accordions collapsed by default~~ → generalized to [C8]** (global). _(AFK)_

### `/programs/legal-advocacy`

- [x] **LA1 — Full-bleed card images** → same as [CS1] (padded inset images → full-bleed). Confirms the full-bleed CardGrid treatment ([C4]) applies to **all** program CardGrids — apply globally. _(AFK)_
- [x] **LA2 — Shorten button copy** → "Join MAPS and Login to the Portal to Request Support" is too long. Shorten the CTA label. _(AFK seed)_
- [x] **LA3 — ~~Remove testimonials section~~ → superseded by [C7]** (use targeted testimonials). _(AFK seed)_
